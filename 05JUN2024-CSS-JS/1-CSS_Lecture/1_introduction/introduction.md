# Introduction to CSS

CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language). It enables web developers to control the layout, design, and appearance of multiple web pages all at once. CSS works by targeting HTML elements and applying styles to them, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.

## What CSS is used for?

- **Styling HTML Elements:** CSS is primarily used for styling HTML elements to enhance the visual presentation of web pages.
- **Layout Design:** It allows developers to control the layout of a web page, including the placement of elements and their arrangement.
- **Responsive Design:** CSS can be used to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Cross-browser Compatibility:** CSS helps ensure that web pages look consistent across different web browsers.
- **Animations and Effects:** CSS also enables the creation of animations, transitions, and other visual effects to enhance user experience.

CSS is an essential technology for web development, working alongside HTML and JavaScript to create engaging and interactive web pages.
