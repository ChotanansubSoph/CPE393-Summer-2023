// Hint: 
// You need to access an element with the ID 'image-container' and change its source attribute to display different images.
// You can use the document.getElementById() method to select this element.
// Once you have the element, listen for a click event on it.
//  Inside the click event listener, update a variable to keep track of the current image index.
//  Make sure to handle the case when the index exceeds the total number of images by resetting it to 1.
//  Finally, update the src attribute of the image container to display the new image based on the current index.
